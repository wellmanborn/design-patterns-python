**Facade** is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified (but limited) interface to a complex system of classes, library or framework.

While Facade decreases the overall complexity of the application, it also helps to move unwanted dependencies to one place.


**Usage examples:** The Facade pattern is commonly used in apps written in Python. Itâ€™s especially handy when working with complex libraries and APIs.

**Identification:** Facade can be recognized in a class that has a simple interface, but delegates most of the work to other classes. Usually, facades manage the full life cycle of objects they use.
